        "In this practical session, we will embark on an insightful journey into the world of Machine Learning (ML) with a focus on cybersecurity, specifically within Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting cybersecurity issues in SCADA networks. This exercise will not only enhance your understanding of ML in cybersecurity but also provide you with hands-on experience in safeguarding critical infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Understanding SCADA Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "SCADA systems are vital for the operation and monitoring of industrial processes. These systems are used to control and supervise equipment and processes in various sectors, including energy, water treatment, and transportation. For instance, in the energy sector, SCADA systems manage the distribution of electricity in power grids, ensuring that the supply meets demand. In water treatment plants, they monitor and control the flow and treatment of water, ensuring safety and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "SCADA networks are critical because they support the seamless operation of our infrastructure, making them prime targets for cyber-attacks. The consequences of a successful attack can range from operational disruptions to significant financial losses and potential threats to public safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset you will be working with has been meticulously compiled from a SCADA system testbed, designed to emulate real-world industrial systems. This testbed was subjected to various cyber-attacks, particularly reconnaissance attacks, where attackers scan the network to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited in future attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key columns in the dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Source Port (Sport)**: This represents the port number of the source in the network transaction, crucial for understanding the communication patterns and potential unauthorized access points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Total Packets (TotPkts)**: This column shows the total number of packets exchanged in a transaction, which can indicate the volume and intensity of network communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Total Bytes (TotBytes)**: Reflects the total amount of data transferred during the transaction, important for detecting large or unusual data transfers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Source Packets (SrcPkts) and Destination Packets (DstPkts)**: These columns provide counts of packets sent from the source to the destination and vice versa, useful for identifying asymmetric traffic flows often seen in cyber-attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Source Bytes (SrcBytes)**: This column indicates the amount of data sent from the source, helping to identify potential data exfiltration attempts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Target** -> Label: Each record is labeled as either part of a network attack or normal activity. This labeling is crucial for training our ML model to differentiate between benign and malicious network behaviors.\n",
